** Uploading to Arduino Nano Every **
Before uploading, open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 1200.
Other baud rates will interfere with the upload process.

** Power consumption **
One line detector sensor (of the ones I already had before starting this project).
  Current measured on:
  - data line: 0.0 uA in any state
  - VCC line
    - 5V:  17.2 mA when detection is on, 19.3 mA when detection is off
    - 3V3: 10.5 mA when detection is on, 11.5 mA when detection is off
